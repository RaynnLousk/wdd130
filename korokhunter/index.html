            <h2>Korok Hunters Collect</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Korok Hunters! This is a page for those who want a quick guide of things to look for when Hunting Koroks in both Breath of the Wild and its' sequal Tears of the Kingdom. On the pages for the respective game you will find a quick rundown of each type of puzzle those Koroks are hiding behind. Be aware that many of the puzzles are similar or even identical as Tears of the Kingdom was originally going to be DLC for Breath of the Wild. With that in mind, the Tears of the Kingdom page will only feature descriptions of the new ones. Magnesis and Ultrahand are treated as the same thing.</p>
