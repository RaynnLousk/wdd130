            <p>Welcome to hunting in Tears of the Kingdom! This page only covers additions not found in Breath of the Wild, so if you can't find the puzzle you are looking at here look at that page as well. There are 100 more Koroks to find in this game, bringing the total to 1000.</p>

                        <h3>Tee up</h3>
                        <p>If you find an upside down caltrop or what looks like a completed golf puzzle from Breath of the Wild, you are going to need to help set the game up again. Ultrahand or otherwise lift the rock out of the hole and onto the stand on a nearby hill. Or build a crazy contraption. It's a whole lot harder, but more fun.</p>

                    <h3>Left behind</h3>
                    <p> The easiest puzzle to see, all you need to do is become an Uber drive and take the Korok back to their friend. Methods vary from pulling them in a wagon, building a Zonai device, picking them up with Ultrahand, and ignoring the request entirely to collect victims for Korok torture chambers or the Korok Space Program.</p>

                        <p>A cork on a chain has different solutions depending on the location. Landbound ones will have a boulder nearby that you can attach to pull out the cork. Ones surrounded by water, all you need to do is submerge the cork. Or attach a rocket to the cork in either place. That works too.</p>

                    <h3>Launch</h3>
                    <p>A variation on the time trial from Breath of the Wild, all you need to do is land on the big glowing target after jumping off. Touching the ground anywhere else fails the challenge instead of running out of time and means another climb back up.</p>

                    <h3>Glyphs</h3>
                    <p>This returning puzzle that now has more solutions. Fusing a rock to a weapon or shield means you can just use that rock. You don't even have to drop the weapon if you don't want to. Just wave it in the right spot.</p>

                        <h3>Signs</h3>
                        <p>Another variation of an old puzzle. Sometimes you find literal signs in an area that point at whatever you need to climb or duck into to find the sparkly leaves.</p>

                        <p>It was stated only new puzzles would appear here, but there are so many of these rocks it bears repeating anyway. Just know not every rock has a Korok underneath, as more were added to give you fuse materials for hammers and axes.</p>

                    <h3>Balloons</h3>
                    <p>There are a few balloons that are just there tucked into corners or behind walls. I'm not sure it counts as a puzzle, but breaking them does give you a Korok.</p>
