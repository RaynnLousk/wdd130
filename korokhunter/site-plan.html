      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This will be a quick guide to collecting Korok seeds for Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and its sequel Tears of the Kingdom. It will not be a listing of all 1900 seeds across both games. It will instead be a guide for what kind of puzzles to look for in each game. There is considerable overlap in the type of puzzles found, but the pages will treat them seperatly as each game has a different set of tools available for most of the overlapping puzzles.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>These guides will be for those new to the games and wish to get an idea of what to expect from this aspect of the game while preserving the exploration aspects.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Welcome to Korok Hunters! This is a page for those who want a quick guide of things to look for when Hunting Koroks in both Breath of the Wild and its' sequal Tears of the Kingdom. On the pages for the respective game you will find a quick rundown of each type of puzzle those Koroks are hiding behind. Be aware that many of the puzzles are similar or even identical as Tears of the Kingdom was originally going to be DLC for Breath of the Wild. With that in mind, the Tears of the Kingdom page will only feature descriptions of the new ones.

      <h3>Breath of the Wild</h3>
      <p>
        Kendama: While you can't throw the ball by lifiting the structure, the goal is still to get the ball into the hole on the log it it chained to. The ball is made of iron, so use magnesis.

        3D Block puzzle: This is a complete the stucture puzzle. There are nearby iron blocks you need magnesis to pick up. Do so and complete whatever pattern there is. Each one uses a different puzzle piece, so there isn't any trick to it.

        Golf: There is an odd hole in the ground. On a nearby hill there should be some boulders. Give them a shove normally or with the stasis rune and get it into the hole. Be aware there are a few places on the map with boldewrs and no hole. Those are for dropping on monsters.

        Flowers: Largeer yellow flowers can dissapear when you approch. It will sprout up nearby. Follow it until it turns white, which means it's the last flower in this chain. If the flowers are in clusters, just touch them in the right order. One flower if the first step, two for the second, ect.

        Fruit Trees: Usually a row of apple trees, these will have different amounts of fruit on them. Make the fruits match for your Korok seed. I have never tries just taking all the fruit, but it would match if you did, right?

        Frozen: Ice blocks can be melted. There can be a Korok inside, but look for missahpened ones.

        Diving: Lily pads in a circle means you need to get high enough and dive in.

        Sparkling path: A patch of concentrated sparkly leafs means there is a Korok inside. These can be found on top of tall structures or flowing along the ground in a patters. 

        Suspisious rock: If it seems out of place and you can pick it up, there's likely a Korok underneath.

        Offerings: A line of statues with offering bowls in front of them, or even just one with an offering bowl needs, usually apples. Toss some in the bowl and the Korok appears. Some only want specific fruit, but there should be hints as to what fruit.

        Glyphs: These patterns of pebbles have a missing rock or two. Find more rocks and complete the pattern.

        Target practice: A pinwheel will mark where you need to stand. Once you are in place, shoot the balloons. Have plenty of bows and arrows with you.

        Race: A stump with a leaf marking marks the start of a time challenge. Follow the sparkles that shoot out to find the goal.

        More rocks: Some rocks stick out of the rivers in a circle. Find a loose rock and throw it in.

        Big acorns: Shoot acorn shaped pots to find Koroks. These can be found hangin from chains, in the hollow of trees, or anywhere else on will fit. The ones the Koroks are still using tin the lost woods don't count.

      </ul>
      <h3>Tears of the Kingdom</h3>
      <p>
        Tee up: If you find an upside down caltrop or what looks like a completed golf puzzle from Breath of the Wild, you are going to need to help set the game up again. Ultrahand or otherwise lift the rock out of the hole and onto the stand on a nearby hill.

        Left behind: The easiest puzzle to see, all you need to do is become an Uber drive and take the Korok back to their friend.

        Dandelions: You can't blow on them, but interecting with them launches the whole thing into the air. Catch it before it hits the ground.

        Uncorking: A cork on a chain has different solutions depending on the location. Landbound ones will have a boulder nearby that you can attach to pull out the cork. Ones surrounded by water, all you need to do is submerge the cork. Or attach a rocket to either, that works too.

        Ascend: Stumps with leaf patterns are no longer just on the ground. You can find them on the ceiling too. Use ascension to go througn the log.

        Launch: A veriation on the time trial from Breath of the Wild, all you need to do is land on the big glowing target after jumping off. touching the ground anywhere else fails the challenge and means another climb back up.

        Glyphs: A returning puzzle that now has more solutions. Fusing a rock to a weapon or shield means you can just use that rock. You don't even have to drop the weapon if you don't want to. Just wave it in the right spot.

        Signs: Another variation of an old puzzle. Sometimes you find literal signs in an area that point at whatever you need to climb or duck into to find the sparkly leaves.

        Suspicious rock: It was stated only new puzzles would appear here, but there are som many of these rocks it bears repeating anyway. Just know not every rock has a Korok underneath, as more were added to give you fuse materials
