                This is the Korork Hunters page for Breath of the Wild! Every tip here is a puzzle type I found in the game and tips on solving each puzzle. There are 900 total seeds, so I'm not going to point each one out. If you don't know what to look for though, this is where you want to be!

                    <p> While you can't throw the ball by lifiting the structure, the goal is still to get the ball into the hole on the log it it chained to. The ball is made of iron, so use magnesis.</p>

                        <h3>3D Block puzzle</h3>
                        <p>This is a complete the stucture puzzle. There are nearby iron blocks you need magnesis to pick up. Do so and complete whatever pattern there is. Each one uses a different puzzle piece, so there isn't any trick to it other than keep rotating.</p>

                        <h3>Golf</h3>
                        <p>There is an odd hole in the ground. On a nearby hill there should be some boulders. Give one a shove normally or with the stasis rune and get it into the hole. It may take a few tries, and it will reset if you leave and come back later without getting that rock in the hoe. Be aware there are a few places on the map with bolders and no hole. Those are for dropping on monsters.</p>

                    <h3>Flowers</h3>
                    <p>Largeer yellow flowers can dissapear when you approch. It will sprout up nearby. Follow it until it turns white, which means it's the last flower in this chain. If the flowers are in clusters, just touch them in the right order. One flower if the first step, two for the second, ect.</p>

                    <h3>Fruit Trees</h3>
                    <p>Usually a row of apple trees, these will have different amounts of fruit on them. Make the fruits match for your Korok seed. I have never tries just taking all the fruit, but it would match if you did, right? Also of note, I stated they are usually apple trees. There are some that are not.</p>

                    <h3>Frozen</h3><p>Ice blocks can be melted. There can be a Korok inside, but look for misshapened ones. There might be other things in the blocks, such as monsters or treasure chests.</p>

                    <h3>Diving</h3><p>Lily pads in a circle means you need to get high enough and dive in the water. Some diving points are right on the edge next to the circle, others seem to be in the stratosphere.</p>

                    <p>A patch of concentrated sparkly leaves means there is a Korok inside. These can be found on top of tall structures or flowing along the ground in a patterns. Catch them.</p>

                    <p>If it seems out of place and you can pick it up, there's likely a Korok underneath. Common enough to be our symbol.</p>

                    <h3>Offerings</h3><p>A line of statues with offering bowls in front of them, or even just one with an offering bowl needs some fruit in the empty bowls, usually apples. Toss some in the bowl and the Korok appears. Some only want specific fruit, but there should be hints as to what fruit.</p>
